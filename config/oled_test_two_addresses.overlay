 * Tidbit Rev2 + Nullbits OLED test overlay for ZMK â€” includes two SSD1306 nodes

 *
 * Build once with this overlay and check which node appears in the generated DTS
 * or which one initializes at runtime. After identifying the working address,
 * remove the unused node or update the node label accordingly.
